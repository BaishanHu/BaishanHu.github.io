## Bio

I am a Research Assistant Professor at Texas A&M University. My research is focused on *ab initio* calculations of nuclei. Starting from two- (NN) and three-nucleon (3N) forces derived within the chiral effective field theory, along with consistent electroweak currents, I primarily use in-medium similarity renormalization group (IMSRG), coupled cluster (CC) and many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) to solve the many-body Schr√∂dinger equation.


## Interests

My research interests cover *ab initio* calculations of nuclear structure and reactions,
as well as related topics such as dark matter, neutrino physics, fundamental
symmetries and nuclear astrophysics.

My work aims to extend the reach of *ab initio* studies in two directions: 1. pushing *ab initio* calculation into heavier mass regions, and 2. obtaining first-principles predictions (with quantified uncertainties) of quantities that cannot be evaluated experimentally, even they reside in the heavy-mass region. These quantities are relevant to astrophysics and searches for physics beyond the Standard Model.
