## [AbInitio4DrkMatter](https://github.com/BaishanHu/AbInitio4DarkMatter)
- **ChEFT_SpinDependent**: Here I provide a Jupyter notebook that calculates the *ab-initio* structure factors for the spin-dependent WIMP-nucleus scattering
- **ChEFT_SpinIndependent**: Here I will provide a Jupyter notebook that calculates the *ab-initio* nuclear structure factors or responses for the spin-independent WIMP-nucleus scattering (coming soon)
- **NREFT**: Non-Relativistic EFT is a complementary approach to tackle the physics of WIMPs-nucleon interactions, and we will provide comparisons with the chiral EFT results (coming soon)

## [SM_PKU](https://github.com/BaishanHu/sm_pku)
Here I provide a shell model code which can do the calculation with complex-energy Hamiltonian, and also can get the expectation of the effective one- and two-body operators.

## [KSHELL code](https://sites.google.com/a/cns.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/kshell/home)
A nuclear shell model calculation code which was recently developed by N. Shimizu with Tokyo nuclear theory group, as described [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1310.5431).
