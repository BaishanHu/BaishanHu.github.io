[ATLAS Masterclass](https://www.triumf.ca/home/for-students/high-school-programs/atlas-masterclass)

TRIUMF had partnered with Simon Fraser University, the University of British Columbia and the University of Victoria to bring the Particle Physics Masterclass experience to high school students in BC. 

During this time, I taught students to analyze real data from the ATLAS project.
